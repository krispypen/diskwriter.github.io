        <h1>The portfolio project</h1>
        <h2>Step One: Making a portfolio is hard.</h2>
        <p>I made my first (and last) portfolio almost 4 years ago. Even though it was a little bit all over the place conceptually I really liked it for three very specific reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I had a portfolio with an astronaut floating in space, while the website rotated around him - which I still think is super cool.</li>
            <li>It got me hired, and isn't that the main goal of any portfolio?</li>
            <li>I learned an important lesson: Making a portfolio is <em>really</em> hard.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The fact that I learned that last lesson might be why it may come as a surprise that I chose to ignore it and delete my portfolio after only a few months of service.</p>
        <p>My main motivation at the time was that I wasn't pleased with the code quality anymore and that it lacked overall performance optimisations. I told myself I'd make a better one and hit <em>delete</em>.</p>
        <p>Since then I've toyed with the wildest ideas, but here we are, almost 4 years later and I still have no portfolio.</p>
        <p>Somehow there are even more things to take into consideration now and making a portfolio has only become harder.</p>
        <p>That's why I decided to start this portfolio project.</p>
        <p>For now, this plain and simple HTML page, hosted on Github Pages will be my portfolio. As I progress step by step, I will archive the previous version and replace it with the next and hopefully at the end of the road, I'll be left with a nice plan of how to make a portfolio... For the next time.</p>

        <p>To be continued...</p>
